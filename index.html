        <div class="eft-terms">*EFT Dates are the dates that your automatic payments will run. EFT Dates that are earlier than Contractual Due Dates will pay off your loan faster. EFT Dates that are setup here to be after the corresponding Contractual Due Dates will not result in extra finance charges. Those payments will apply as if they were made on the Contractual Due Dates. EFT dates must be within a certain number of days of the Contractual Due Dates, depending on the installment frequency, and there must be at least 6 days between adjacent EFT Dates.</div>
